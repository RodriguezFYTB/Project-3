                    My name is Jorge Rodriguez and I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in IT
                    at Illinois Institute of Technology through Coursera. The following page is more about me,
                    what I have done and plan on doing!

                Basketball is more than a sport, ITS A LIFESTYLE! When it comes to staying active, for me***, its basically like food and water.
                Basketball has been my number one sport for as long as I can imagine and any chance I could be on a team, I took it! From 5th/6th grade teams (casual) to working up the ladders of Freshman and Junior Varsity, high school varsity would just be a mere cap to a longer journey ahead of me.
                Solo hours to pure recovery is what allowed me to earn a starting JUCO role and eventually transfer to a NCAA Division III program.

                <p>
                    Videos games brought out the IT Specialist in all of us without even knowing! From installing/removing software to maintaining proper updates
                    A little tech knowledge (technology haha) is the new norm of the 21st Century with phones and computers EVERYWHERE! You're reading this one of them just like I am coding this document on one.
                    Now, I was late to join the console party BUT luckily I had a nice 2011 Mac Desktop that my dad bought and a fresh copy of Minecraft ready to be played.
                    At this time I had graced upon the greatness of Grand Theft Auto and Mortal Kombat (Yes I was 10/11 Years old) but the main reason why I hold Minecraft so high
                    is because of how easy it was to mod. This was kind of my first instance messing with code! Most of them were drag and drop files to a nice Mod folder, but that mod folder wouldn't be there without proper setting up.
                    As a pre-teen YOUTUBE helped me find the way when it came to computers. From there I was able to save up and build my first gaming setup from pc building to set ups and troubleshooting software!
